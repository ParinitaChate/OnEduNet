Student Engagement Detection in Virtual Classrooms
This repository contains code for detecting student engagement in online learning environments using machine learning. It features OnEduNet, a custom CNN model integrating visual features and contextual metadata (age, gender) for improved classification. The model outperforms pre-trained architectures like MobileNet and Xception, achieving 92% validation accuracy and an F1-score of 0.92 on the Student Engagement and Disengagement Image Dataset (16,000 labeled images). The dataset is structured to support deep learning applications in real-time engagement monitoring. The project utilizes transfer learning, ReLU activation, and batch normalization with an Adam optimizer for efficient training. The repository includes scripts for training, evaluation, and dataset preprocessing. Future work aims to integrate multimodal inputs (audio, text) and real-world deployment. Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run train_onedunet.py to train the model. Released under the MIT License. ðŸš€
